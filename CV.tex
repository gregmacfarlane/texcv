{\acc CCE 201: Sustainable Infrastructure}

\vspace{-.4cm}
The inter-related aspects of the different civil engineering disciplines of
environmental, geotechnical, structural, transportation, and water resources and
how they come together to develop an infrastructure system. Time value of money
and application to the infrastructure investment alternatives.

\begin{tabular}{cccc}
  \toprule
  Semester & Enrolled & Student Rating (Historical) & Average GPA\\
  \midrule
  Fall 2020 & 33 & 4.1 - 4.7 (4.1)& 3.41 \\
  Fall 2021 & 64 & 4.1 - 4.5 (4.3)& 3.25 \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

Selected student comments:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Early in the course, Dr. Macfarlane made it clear, without really ever
    having to say so, that he cares about his students, wants us to think
    critically and ask questions, that he's really approachable and welcomes
    feedback. Overall shows high respect and high but reasonable expectations
    for students.
  \item Professor Macfarlane was always very respectful to students in the class. He
    was always willing to answer students questions or spend some time to
    further explain a concept. He was always very patient and came to class
    every day with a positive attitude and excited for class.
  \item thought he always did a good job explaining concepts in class and I thought it was very helpful to have the class notes website because it made reviewing a lot easier.
  \item I see the world a lot differently now. Different facets of sustainability are so intertwined and there's so much to consider. I feel so much more capable of making important decisions, but also more inclined to look for more perspectives.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{.4cm}
{\acc CE 361: Introduction to Transportation Engineering}

\vspace{-.4cm}

  Winter 2021 & 38 & 4.1 - 4.7 (4.4) & 3.21 \\
  \bottomrule

\end{tabular}

Selected student comments:
\begin{itemize}
  \item I appreciated that he changed up the class significantly in response to midterm
  ratings. it would have been very easy to keep going with the material he was
  given, but he really made it his own and made the class so much better as a
  result.
  \item Just like the best BYU professors are. Respectful and caring about his students.
  \item He has by far been my best teacher in this whole transition to online classes situation.
  \item This class reinforced to me that I want to end up in the public sector of
transportation engineering/planning/public works. I want to work in and with
local governments to solve problems for people around me.
  \item He would take extra care to make sure that we understood the material that we were learning. Dr. Macfarlane cares a lot about his students and wants to help them in any way that he can so he takes time in lecture to answer questions.
  \item Dr. Macfarlane always seemed to have a really good understanding of the bigger picture and shared it with us, about how different facets of systems work together to make our infrastructure work great to serve people, or sometimes the opposite.
\end{itemize}


\fi

\vspace{.4cm}

  Fall 2021 & & & \\
  \bottomrule

\end{tabular}

Selected student comments:
\begin{itemize}
  \item  I'm still amazed at his quickness in responding to Slack messages, no matter
    the time of day! Dr. Macfarlane is one of the most kind professors I've had,
    he's extremely willing to work with you until you understand the concept
    that he's teaching you.
  \item The class was organized to teach us theory by allowing us to see it in action through models, which I think helped solidify those concepts.
  \item I appreciated the discussions on ethics and applying them to our work - few of my classes have mentioned them more than once in a semester, and rarely with applicable concerns.
  \item I have more of a desire to be involved in the planning process in the future communities that I'll live in.
\end{itemize}

\fi

{\acc CE 594R: Data Science for Engineers}

\vspace{-.4cm}

  \bottomrule

\end{tabular}

Selected student comments:
\begin{itemize}
  \item I know you didn't have to teach this course, but I appreciate you doing it.
    When I signed up for the course, I thought I would learn about data science
    techniques (as what I should look for in analyzing data--types of tests to
    perform, processes, etc). I think that could be a good edition that could
    come from Dr. Macfarlane, is teaching more about data science and what that
    entails, rather than just use R to solve problems.
    \item I felt like he was pretty good at responding to emails and being merciful and helpful and understanding. He definitely recognized that this semester was different and was flexible.
    \item I really appreciated Dr. Macfarlane and he did curate some great resources for us to use. He was willing and available to help. And he was flexible and merciful in the midst of a challenging and different semester.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{.4cm}
{\acc CE 662: Transport Simulation and Analysis}

\vspace{-.4cm}

  Winter 2020 & 3 & 5.0 - 5.0 (4.4) & 3.00 \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

Selected student comments:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Dr. Macfarlane is really patient in explaining the challenging concepts, and he will find the simple way to describe or teach twice to make sure we totally understand.
\item Always came well prepared to lectures. It was obvious that he had put time,
  thought, and effort into preparing an engaging and effective lecture, every
  time.
\item The instructor expected us to use critical thinking and to not just go for the
  "right" answer without thought about it. I think this is a valuable way of
  building students' character.
\item The course was well organized because it was clearly explained how new
  material builds from the previous subject. It was easy to see the progression
  of how each lecture builds from the last and prepares you for the next.
\end{itemize}
\fi


\vspace{.4cm}
{\acc CE 694R: Advanced Choice Modeling}

\vspace{-.4cm}
